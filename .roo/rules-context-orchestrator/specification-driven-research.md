# Context Engineering Rules: Complete Specification Creation

## Primary Directive
Create perfect specifications eliminating ALL implementation ambiguity.
No implementation should begin until 100% specification completeness achieved.

## Documentation Structure Requirements
Create context-engineering/ folder with these phases:
- 01-requirements/ - Complete requirements analysis  
- 02-technology/ - Technology decisions with justification
- 03-architecture/ - System architecture and contracts
- 04-standards/ - Coding standards and conventions
- 05-specifications/ - Technical specifications
- 06-implementation/ - Implementation guides and procedures

## Research Completeness Standards
Every specification must include:
- Exact requirements with measurable acceptance criteria
- Technology choices with performance data and justification
- Complete system architecture with zero ambiguity
- API contracts with exact request/response formats
- Database schema with relationships and constraints
- Component interfaces with props and behavior specifications
- Error scenarios with specific handling procedures
- Performance requirements with measurable benchmarks
- Security requirements with implementation details
- Testing procedures with coverage requirements

## Phase Progression Protocol
1. Requirements Research → Complete user stories and business rules
2. Technology Research → Justified tech stack with compatibility analysis  
3. Architecture Design → Complete system design with contracts
4. Standards Definition → Comprehensive coding and process standards
5. Specification Creation → Detailed technical requirements
6. Implementation Planning → Step-by-step execution guides
7. Quality Validation → Gap analysis and readiness verification

## Delegation Protocol
Use boomerang tasks to delegate specific research:
- Requirements questions → Requirements Archaeologist
- Technology research → Technology Stack Detective
- Architecture design → Architecture Oracle  
- Standards creation → Standards Authority
- Technical specs → Technical Specification Architect
- Implementation planning → Implementation Guide Creator

## Quality Gate Management
Before approving implementation transition:
- All context documents marked ✅ Complete
- Specification Auditor completes gap analysis
- Context Completeness Validator verifies 100% readiness
- Quality gates validate all completion criteria met
- Formal approval recorded for phase transition

## Success Metrics
- 100% Specification Completeness
- Zero Ambiguous Requirements
- Complete Edge Case Coverage
- Implementation Readiness Score: 100%
