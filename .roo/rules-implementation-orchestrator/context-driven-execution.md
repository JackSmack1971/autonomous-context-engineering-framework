# Implementation Rules: Context-Driven Execution

## Primary Directive
The context-engineering/ folder contains the complete specification universe. 
NEVER deviate from these specifications. Everything has been pre-decided.

## Context Validation Prerequisites
Before starting ANY implementation:
- Verify context-engineering/ folder exists in project root
- Confirm all phase folders contain completed documentation
- Check all documents show âœ… Complete status (not ðŸ”„ Pending)  
- Validate implementation readiness per validation-criteria.md

## Implementation Sequence (Non-Negotiable)
Follow EXACT sequence from task-breakdown.md:

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
1. Database Implementation Specialist â†’ Schema per database-schema-detailed.md
2. DevOps Implementation Specialist â†’ CI/CD per deployment-architecture.md  
3. Backend Implementation Specialist â†’ Base API structure per system-architecture.md

**Phase 2: Core Backend Implementation**  
1. API Endpoint Builder â†’ Authentication endpoints first
2. Backend Implementation Specialist â†’ Core business logic services
3. Integration Implementation Specialist â†’ External services 
4. Testing Implementation Specialist â†’ Backend test suites

**Phase 3: Frontend Implementation**
1. UI Component Builder â†’ Components per component-specifications.md
2. Frontend Implementation Specialist â†’ Pages and routing
3. Testing Implementation Specialist â†’ Frontend test suites

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance**
1. QA Validator â†’ Validate all acceptance criteria
2. Performance Validator â†’ Validate performance requirements
3. Security Validator â†’ Validate security requirements

## Context Reference Protocol
Each mode MUST reference specific context documents:
- coding-conventions.md for style and structure
- technical-requirements.md for performance and security
- validation-criteria.md for quality gates
- testing-procedures.md for testing approach

## Zero Creative Decisions Protocol
If ANY ambiguity encountered:
1. Search context-engineering/ folder thoroughly
2. If unclear, STOP implementation and create boomerang task
3. NEVER make assumptions or implement "reasonable" defaults
4. Wait for context engineering team clarification

## Quality Gate Validation
Before proceeding to next phase:
- Current implementation validated against context specs
- All tests pass per testing-procedures.md
- Code follows coding-conventions.md exactly
- Performance meets technical-requirements.md benchmarks
- Security requirements satisfied per specifications

## Implementation Status Tracking
Maintain progress for:
- Phase completion against task-breakdown.md  
- Quality gate compliance against validation-criteria.md
- Test coverage against testing-standards.md
- Performance benchmarks against technical-requirements.md
- Security requirements against security specifications

## Success Metrics
- 100% Specification Compliance
- Zero Creative Decisions Made
- Quality Gate Passage on First Attempt
- Context Traceability for All Decisions
