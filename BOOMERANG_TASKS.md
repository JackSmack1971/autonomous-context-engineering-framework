## üîÑ Boomerang Task Best Practices

### Task Creation Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what information is needed and why
2. **Provide Context**: Include all relevant background information
3. **Set Clear Deliverables**: Specify exactly what output is expected
4. **Include Constraints**: Document limitations, deadlines, and requirements
5. **Reference Standards**: Point to existing documentation or standards to follow

### Task Assignment Guidelines

1. **Match Expertise**: Assign tasks to modes with relevant expertise
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite information is available
3. **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Don't create loops between modes
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track task completion and quality
5. **Validate Outputs**: Review deliverables before marking complete

### Quality Validation

Before accepting boomerang task results:
- [ ] All requested information provided
- [ ] Deliverables meet specified format and quality standards
- [ ] Assumptions and limitations clearly documented
- [ ] Dependencies and constraints addressed
- [ ] Validation criteria met

**Remember**: Boomerang tasks are the key to maintaining zero ambiguity throughout the context engineering process. Use them liberally to ensure every decision is properly researched and documented.
