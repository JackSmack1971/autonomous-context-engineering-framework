# Autonomous Context Engineering Framework

> **Transform any project from ambiguous requirements into 99% autonomous implementation through perfect specification creation.**

## 🎯 What This Framework Does

This framework creates an **Autonomous Context Engineering Pipeline** that eliminates the "figuring out what to build" problem entirely. Instead of coding modes having to make assumptions or ask clarifying questions, they get handed a **perfect specification universe** where every decision has already been researched, validated, and documented.

### The Zero-Ambiguity Promise

After this context engineering pipeline, implementation modes will have:

✅ **Every API endpoint** specified with exact request/response formats  
✅ **Every database table** designed with relationships and indexes  
✅ **Every component interface** defined with props and state management  
✅ **Every error scenario** documented with handling procedures  
✅ **Every business rule** specified with validation logic  
✅ **Every UI interaction** detailed with exact behavior specifications  
✅ **Every integration point** documented with configuration details  
✅ **Every testing scenario** pre-written with expected outcomes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- VS Code with Roo Code extension installed
- API keys configured for AI providers
- MCP servers setup (optional but recommended for research modes)

### 2. Open the Project
```bash
# Open in VS Code
code autonomous-context-engineering-framework
```

### 3. Start Context Engineering Process

#### Phase 1: Project Initialization
1. Open Roo Code panel in VS Code
2. Switch to **🎯 Context Engineering Orchestrator** mode
3. Provide initial project requirements/brief
4. Let the orchestrator create a comprehensive research plan

#### Phase 2: Research & Analysis (100% Research)
The orchestrator will delegate to specialist modes:
- **Requirements Archaeologist** will dig deep into business needs
- **Technology Stack Detective** will research optimal technology choices
- **Architecture Oracle** will design complete system architecture
- **Standards Authority** will establish coding conventions

#### Phase 3: Specification Creation (100% Documentation)
Specialist modes will create detailed specifications:
- **PRD Craftsperson** creates comprehensive product requirements
- **Technical Specification Architect** transforms requirements into technical specs
- **Implementation Guide Creator** creates step-by-step implementation instructions

#### Phase 4: Validation & Quality Assurance (100% Verification)
Quality assurance modes validate completeness:
- **Specification Auditor** reviews all documentation for gaps
- **Context Completeness Validator** confirms implementation readiness

#### Phase 5: Autonomous Implementation (99% Mechanical)
Switch to **💻 Code** mode and begin implementation:
